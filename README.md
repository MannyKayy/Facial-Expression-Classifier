# Facial-Expression-Classifier
#### _Convolutional Neural Network & Mixture of Gaussians implementation for the Toronto Faces Dataset_

This assignment compares the differences in convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) models by experimenting on classification using the Toronto Faces Dataset (TFD). There are 3374, 419 and 385 grayscale images from TFD for the training, validation and testing sets respectively. Each image is 48x48 pixels of a face with a particular facial expression. Each face has been pre rotated, scaled and aligned. Facial expressions fall into one of seven categories: 1-Anger, 2-Disgust, 3-Fear, 4-Happy, 5-Sad, 6-Surprise, 7-Neutral.

Dataset Discription:
* `toronto_face.npz`
  * Contains 3374, 419 and 385 grayscale 48x48 images from TFD for the training, validation and testing sets respectively.
